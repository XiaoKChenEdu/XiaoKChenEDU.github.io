*Our assignment was to develop a sophisticated web application designed to replace a company's Excel-based financial tracking system. The goal was to create a more efficient, user-friendly, and scalable solution that could handle the complexities of financial tracking far better than traditional Excel spreadsheets. This involved a thorough understanding of both financial processes and web development technologies, making it a challenging yet immensely rewarding task.*

## The Bads
On the first day of this course, we had the opportunity to meet our teammates, and I was open to working with anyone. We discussed our approach to the project, and one member suggested using the Next.js framework instead of Meteor, noting that it would enhance our resumes and that Next.js was notably faster. I agreed and was excited about the prospect, as our group seemed to be on board with the decision.

However, around two to three weeks into the project, after I had already developed two pages using Next.js, a team member expressed difficulties with it and proposed switching back to Meteor. To resolve this, we decided to vote on whether to continue with Next.js or revert to Meteor. Ultimately, the majority voted to go back to Meteor.

This outcome was quite disappointing for me, as I was eager to work with a new framework and was prepared to take on the project independently if necessary. Some team members showed little effort in the initial weeks, and this continued throughout the course, which added to my frustration.

## Outcome
Ultimately, I found myself investing minimal effort into the project due to the lack of progress and the poor communication within our group. It became evident that there was barely any coordination among team members, and this lack of interaction made it challenging to move forward effectively.

Although I recognize that I wasn't fully meeting my responsibilities, I decided to shift my focus to my engineering project on Antenna Array Beamforming. This project seemed more impactful for my resume and career prospects. The course itself had a fantastic concept, aiming to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world applications. Unfortunately, our execution fell short, and the project's potential was hindered by our team's inability to collaborate effectively.

In the end, while the course provided a valuable opportunity to interact with real-world scenarios, it highlighted the importance of teamwork and communication, which are essential for the success of any collaborative project.
