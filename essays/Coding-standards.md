*What is Coding Standard?*

Coding standards are a set of guidelines used in programming that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in a specific language. They are designed to ensure that code is easy to read, maintain, and debug.

## Why is it important

Coding standards are crucial for several reasons:

- Readability: Consistent coding style makes the code easier to read and understand, especially when multiple developers are working on the same project.
- Maintainability: It’s easier to maintain and update code that follows a consistent style and structure.
- Reducing Errors: Many coding standards are designed to prevent common programming errors. For example, a rule that requires always using braces with control structures can prevent errors when additional lines are added.
- Collaboration: When everyone uses the same coding standard, it’s easier for a developer to understand someone else’s code and contribute to it.

## ESLint with IntelliJ

We’ve opted to use ESLint to enforce the Airbnb JavaScript standard. The integration of ESLint with IntelliJ offers immediate feedback on code quality and compliance with coding standards, right within the IDE. By configuring ESLint within IntelliJ, rule violations are automatically detected, streamlining the development process. 

I must admit, it’s a bit frustrating. I have a specific coding style that I prefer, such as aligning comments for easier readability. However, this style conflicts with one of the ESLint rules that disallows multiple spaces. It’s a habit I’ll need to adjust to. Despite this, I understand the importance of having a standardized coding style. It ensures consistency, making it easier for others to understand the code, as they can expect the same style throughout.
