*What is Javascript?*

JavaScript is like the magic behind the scenes on websites. It’s a language that your web browser understands and uses to do things on web pages. For example, when you see a page updating new information without you refreshing it, or when you see interactive maps and animations, that’s JavaScript working. Even though it has “Java” in its name, it’s not the same as Java, which is a completely different language.

## Comparing it to other languages

Based from the practice that I've done in ES6, I find that JavaScript is generally more intuitive compared to languages like C/C++. However, it does have a specific syntax style, which is unlike Python’s more flexible approach. Unlike C/C++, you don’t need to declare types in JavaScript. This aspect is similar to Python, making both languages more beginner-friendly.

## Software engineering perspective on JavaScript

JavaScript is a good programming language. Like Python and Java, JavaScript has a large, active community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can speed up web development. JavaScript also allowed for procedural, object-oriented and functional programming. Having an active community surrounding JavaScript ensures continuous improvements, abundant resources, and peer support.

## WODs

The practice WODs in this class is beneficial. The questions strike a balance of difficulty - they aren’t as challenging as those on LeetCode, yet they’re not overly simple either. I appreciate this learning approach as it’s likely to be advantageous for future coding interviews, should I pursue a career as a software engineer. ICS 314 is perceived as having a substantial workload, I’m currently managing it without feeling overwhelmed. However, as the semester progresses and the demands of my other classes come into play, the situation could potentially become more stressful.
