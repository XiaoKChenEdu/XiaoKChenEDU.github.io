Over the course of this comprehensive software engineering program that spanned eighteen weeks, I’ve absorbed a wealth of knowledge that transcends the boundaries of web application development. Two areas that particularly resonated with me were configuration management and coding standards.

## Configuration Management

At its core, configuration management is about overseeing and controlling modifications in a software program. It’s comparable to maintaining a detailed ledger of all source code, documentation, and configuration files that were utilized during your project’s lifecycle. By employing version control systems like Git, you can effectively manage alterations and ensure that various iterations of your software can be reliably produced and deployed. We explored how to use GitHub for team-based work, how to create and merge branches, and how to resolve merge conflicts using Git. I recall an episode during our project when a team member initiated work without updating to the latest version of the code, leading to a significant effort to resolve merge conflicts. This incident underscored the importance of version control and change tracking, which can prevent similar issues in the future. It underscores the pivotal role of configuration management in fostering effective team collaboration towards a shared vision.

## Coding standards

Coding standards are vital for readability, maintainability, error reduction, and collaboration. A consistent coding style enhances readability and understanding, especially in multi-developer projects. It also simplifies maintenance and updates. Coding standards often prevent common programming errors, such as a rule requiring the use of braces with control structures to avoid errors when adding additional lines. When everyone adheres to the same coding standard, it facilitates understanding and contribution to someone else’s code. We’ve chosen ESLint to enforce the Airbnb JavaScript standard. Its integration with IntelliJ provides immediate feedback on code quality and standard compliance. Configuring ESLint within IntelliJ automatically detects rule violations, streamlining the development process. While it can be frustrating to adjust to a specific coding style, such as aligning comments for readability. Having a normalized coding standards ensures consistency, making it easier for others to understand the code, as the same style is expected throughout. Despite the initial frustration, the benefits of standardization in facilitating understanding and collaboration are recognized.
